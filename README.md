# Planner
 The source for the Planner app, initially released on the Apple App Store

This app was written/released in 2007/2008 and removed from the App Store around 2009 (when I, honestly, just ran out of time to maintain it.)

It is most likely that this app will no longer compile, and even if it does I would be very surprised if it sitll works as intended. This was also one of my first "major" coding projects that was ever released, and there are no doubt some poor practices to be found.

This is released as open source just to have the code out there for anyone who is curious. iOS has built in, better tools now that supercede this app, but that's not to say that there aren't improvements that could be made. Taking/modifying this code is fine, but on the condition that the result also remains open source.
